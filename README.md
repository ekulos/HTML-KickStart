# HTML KickStart

## What is HTML KickStart?

HTML KickStart is an ultra–lean set of HTML5, CSS, and jQuery (javascript) files, layouts, and elements designed to give you a headstart and save you 10's of hours on your next web project.

## How HTML KickStart Works

HTML KickStart includes everything you need to rapidly create website layouts – things like slideshows, menus, flexible grids, image placeholders, buttons, and more – saving you a ton of time so you can produce faster and make more money.

Bonus! All HTML KickStart Elements are fully Browser tested, they even gracefully degrade ;)
